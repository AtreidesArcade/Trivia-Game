# Trivia-Game

Created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

*You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

*The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

*The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

*Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

*Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

*Make sure to create button to restart the game without refreshing the page.
